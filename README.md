Offuture Descriptive Analytics Project


Project Overview


This project focuses on descriptive analytics for Offuture, a global online office and technology supply store. The aim is to analyze Offuture's performance data from 2011 to 2015, providing a trustworthy and insightful proof of concept after a previous consultancy firm failed to meet expectations.


The analysis emphasizes performance trends in sales and profits, as well as identifying best- and worst-performing products, categories, and segments. The insights generated will help Offuture refine their strategies and build trust for future predictive modeling efforts.
